AIM/ABSTRACT
This project introduces a predictive system for targeting customers in term deposit marketing campaigns. By harnessing machine learning algorithms and customer data, the system forecasts whether a customer will respond positively ("yes") or negatively ("no") to a term deposit offer. Through analysis of customer attributes and historical data, the project aims to optimize campaign effectiveness, boost engagement, and improve conversion rates.

OBJECTIVE
Build a system that predicts whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit.
Use this system to select the right customers for marketing campaigns.
Improve the efficiency of our marketing efforts and save costs.
DATA AVAILABILITY
